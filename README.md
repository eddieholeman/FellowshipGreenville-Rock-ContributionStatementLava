# Rock_ContributionStatementLava_block

The issue was that the pledge progress bar available on the Giving History page via the ContributionStatementLava block was not showing our pledges because the block code used a Statement Year as a filter.  Because our campaign is a multi-year campaign, the bar showed nothing.  I modified the block code by removing this filter.  Now the pledge progress bar displays accurately for this campaign.
